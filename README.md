# "NameLess"
## About the game: 
This game is about speed and attention. It does not have a name. The objective of the game is to read the "code" at the top of the page, and then click on the buttons that are randomly and rapidly appearing on the screen in the same order as they appear in the "code" at the top.

How to play: 

- The Code will appear at the top.
- Press the squares as they appear to match the pattern.
- You must press them in order at they appear.
- If you press three wrong then you lose.
- If you match the code, then you may move onto the next round.
