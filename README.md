<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![ezgif-1-5242fb8826](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83780176/155367266-b4948399-d7aa-4961-9e3c-2d3082ac7dfb.gif)

  PressTime is a fun interactive game that tests your skills with your computer's mouse. The objective of the game is to press the number's as they appear in the same order as displayed at the top of the screen. To beat the game, you must make it past all three levels. As the developer, I have not passed level 3. 

**Features:**

- A landing page including a start button and a modal for how to play.
- A modal to display and explain how to play the game.
- An indication of what level a user is on and how mych time they have to complete the level.
- A randomly generated "code" that a user must follow.
- A "wrongs" indicator to let the user know how many times they clicked the wrong square.
- A timer to let the user know how much time has elapsed.
- The 3x3 square of chaning numbers to click on.
- A selection area that adds the number that has been clicked on if correct in order for a user to track their progress.
- An alert for when a level has been beat. 
- If time has run out user is sent back to landing page.
- When the level is beat a "Next Level" button appears.
